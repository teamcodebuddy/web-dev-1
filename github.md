## Warmup 

1. What happens when you type `www.replit.com` in your browser and you hit enter?
1. What are the 3 langauges needed to render a webpage in your browser? 

## Creating a Github Account: 

Before we get started, we are going to create a github so that we can store and share our code somewhere other than repl. 

Sign-up link: https://github.com/signup?source=login

Store your username and password somewhere safe.

Once you are done watch the following video explaining what Github is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E

## HTML Review 

1. Create the following files in your project directory: 
    * `about.html` 
    * `blog.html`   
    * `contact.html`

1. Create a bulleted list of links at the top of each page that you just created
    * Home 
    * About 
    * Blog 
    * Contact 

1. Add a relevant Heading to each page of your site 

1. Add a sentence to each page of your site


## CSS 

Today we will be writing our own CSS to stylize our webpage. 

### 3 Places where we can write CSS:

1. In-line 

```html 

```

1. In the `<style>` tag 
1. 







In our CSS file, we create **element selectors**, or code that selectively styles HTML elements based on their names. 

For example, if I wanted all of my paragraphs to be green, I would add the following code to my CSS page: 

```css
p {
  color: green;
}

```

** DO NOW: ** 

Change the color of all paragraphs to a color of your choice. 

There are a BUNCH of CSS attributes that we can be adding to our element selectors:
